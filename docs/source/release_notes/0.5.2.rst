0.5.2 beta
==========

Gimel Studio v0.5.2 beta was released "March 4, 2021"


General
-------

 * Refactoring and cleanup of code
 * MacOs support was tested


Node Graph
----------

 * Added new feature to toggle showing the rendered image as the node graph background. (With this setting enabled, the viewport does update slightly slower).


Nodes
-----

 * Added **new core nodes**: *Crop* with the option for both square and circluar crop (thanks to @iwoithe)


Bug Fixes
---------

 * It was found that the Add Node search bar was not working properly because of a possible bug in wxpython 4.1.1. Downgrading to 4.1.0 solves the issue.
